Michael Pinkard is a software developer and geographer currently based in Vancouver, Canada.

Originally hailing from the Seattle area, Michael studied mathematics at Lafayette College and on a Fulbright Scholarship to Germany before entering software development.

Leveraging his technical and analytical skills, Michael worked in a variety of Bay Area start-ups, including Nerdwallet and Pared. Michael's work spanned the stack: from data pipelines at Zephyr Health handling millions of lines of healthcare data to nitty gritty CSS work on Nerdwallet's premier React apps, and everything in-between.

Taking a break from the start-up lifestyle to pursue other interests, Michael is currently completing a MA in Human Geography at the University of British Columbia, studying food systems and conflicts over agricultural science.
